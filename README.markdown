The Atriplex Project
====================
The atriplex project can be found at http://atriplex.org

The assets must be precompiled for the application to work properly on Heroku Cedar. In order to do that, please run: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile` before you push so a current version of the precompiled assets exist inside the repo.
